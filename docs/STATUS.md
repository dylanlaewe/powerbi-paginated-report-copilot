# Status

Current milestone: first real PBIR generation spike accepted for this stage after independent Windows testing confirmed project opening and recognition of the generated page, visuals, and semantic model without corruption or repair.

Implemented: secure Electron shell, React status UI, strict workspace configuration, runtime-validated domain seed, automated quality workflow, and truthful documentation baseline.

Spike-only implementation: immutable known-valid fixture, minimum TMDL inventory, disposable copy, verified backup, PBIR page/card/chart/slicer authoring, reference checks, official CLI validation, and evidence manifests.

Windows limitation for PBIR: fixture-wide data retrieval failed on both the generated page and original Page 1, so populated rendering, interactive filtering, and visual quality remain unverified.

Current RDL result: **FAILED**. Although `Regional Sales Detail.rdl` passed XML well-formedness and the existing XSD validation, independent Windows testing produced an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` while Report Builder attempted to open it. Design and Preview were not reached; embedded data execution and PDF/Excel export were not tested. The generation mechanism is not proven, and the spike must not merge.

Next compatibility gate: derive a minimal two-column, three-row candidate from the canonical Report Builder-authored `samples/report-builder-seeds/KnownGoodEnterDataTable.rdl` seed, then confirm that Report Builder opens it without an exception. The seed is not present on the current remote spike branch as of 2026-07-20.
